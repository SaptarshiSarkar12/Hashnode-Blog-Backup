## Best Developer Tools For Increasing Productivity

# Tired of writing tedious code all the time?
Here are 5 best tools to increase your productivity while programming.

## 1. Markdown File Creating Website
Link to the website : [readme.so](https://readme.so/) . 

It is a great open-source website for making Markdown files for your repositories. It has in-built sections and support for custom sections as well. Besides having support for light and dark modes, it also has a preview sidebar for viewing your markdown file right in it. Moreover, it stores the changes made in the website without having to create an account. Hence, when you later come back, you can start from where you left off.

## 2. Paste JSON file text as code

## 3. Getting Version Information of packages
Link to the Extension[Only in VS Code] : [Version Lens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pflannery.vscode-versionlens). 

This extension shows version information when opening a package or project. So, you don't need to reach out to the package manager to find package update information.

## 4. Colorize Brackets
Link to the extension[Only in VS Code] : [Bracket Padder](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=viablelab.bracket-padder).

This extension automatically closes all the open brackets used in a programming files. Brackets can be very messy and confusing in languages like java, but now no more with this extension.
